## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.11.3

## Hypothesis:
This repository focuses on developing three hypotheses and then testing them using data.
The full process can be explored in the EDA Jupyter Notebook.
The following three hypotheses were examined:

1. Houses in cities show higher price efficiency than houses in rural areas.
2. Renovation has a smaller impact on property value in rural regions.
3. Central locations have higher demand, reflected in geographic price patterns.
